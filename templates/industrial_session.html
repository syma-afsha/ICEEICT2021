                A special session on the industry-academia bridging is planned to better prepare the future leaders of
                the
                developing and underdeveloped countries. ICEEICT 2021 are soliciting interest from the academic experts
                and
                representatives of the leading industries to magnify the session in supporting the dreams of our fresh
                graduates
                and young stars.

                <br>
                <br>

                The session is expected to explore the reasons for potential gaps between academia and industries and
                their
                way-outs. The needs and expectations of the industries, technology development initiatives, and
                opportunities
                for internships and projects would also provide new insights to those future leaders to change the
                world!
